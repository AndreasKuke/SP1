My take at making a game including all the tasks we were given such as:
  -Variable implementation
  -Boolean operators
  -Loops
  -return etc.

  I will be honest and say though. Somewhat halfway through it became very cluttered and even i have a hard time finding stuff in it when i needed to fix stuff.
  I take this with me as experience for next time and will try to make it better.
